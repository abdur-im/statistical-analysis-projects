## Introduction
This project was undertaken in collaboration with a team from the University of Toronto for the course STA304H5 F - Surveys, Sampling and Observational Data. For a deeper understanding of the collaborative nature of this work, kindly access the project [PDF 'Smartphone_Usage_and_Mental_Health.pdf'](Smartphone_Usage_and_Mental_Health.pdf).

In 2020, the global pandemic transformed the way students live and learn. Given the significant lifestyle changes, this study was initiated to explore potential shifts in smartphone usage patterns and their subsequent impact on the mental well-being of STA304H5 students during the pandemic.

## Methodology
We sourced our data from a survey administered to the STA304H5 Fall 2022 UTM students. The survey touched on students' smartphone habits, mental well-being, and the broader impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on aspects like finance and academics.

Post-collection, the survey data was processed into a CSV format. Rigorous data cleaning followed, prioritizing participant confidentiality and optimizing the dataset for R-based analysis. Redundant data columns were omitted, and the streamlined dataset is accessible [here](dataset.csv).

Our primary research objectives were:

1. Assessing changes in smartphone usage before and during COVID-19.
2. Understanding fluctuations in students' mental health over the pandemic.
3. Investigating the influence of gender and other factors on reported well-being metrics.

## Discussion and Results
The data was presented using visual aids like boxplots. Here's a summarized view of our findings:

1. Smartphone usage showed a visible increase during the pandemic, with average screen time rising from 4 hours pre-pandemic to 6 hours during COVID-19.
  
2. When segregated by gender, it became evident that the median smartphone usage for females, for instance, shifted from 5 hours pre-pandemic to 7 hours during the pandemic.

3. The mental well-being of students witnessed a decline during the pandemic. Before COVID-19, the average mental health score was 14, which later dropped to 12 during the pandemic.

## Limitations
While our study provides valuable insights, it's crucial to acknowledge certain constraints:

1. The primary mode of participant selection was during lectures, potentially leaving out a segment of non-attending students.
2. The survey's low Cronbachâ€™s alpha indicates that it might lack reliability and consistency.
3. The responses are self-reported, possibly introducing a level of bias.

## Conclusion
The investigation indicates a notable shift in smartphone usage and a decline in mental well-being among STA304H5 students during the pandemic. These findings underscore the significance of adapting teaching methodologies and providing support structures that align with the new normal. However, it's pertinent to further refine research methods for more definitive outcomes.
