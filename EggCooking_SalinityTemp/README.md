## Introduction
This project was completed in collaboration with a team. For specifics about individual contributions, please refer to the main project PDF.

Although the consumption of eggs is common worldwide and considered a staple in many households due to its richness in protein, the cooking time of an egg is widely disputed. This experimental study aims to investigate whether factors such as water temperature and water salinity influence the internal temperature of an egg given a controlled 10 minutes of boiling time. The results obtained from this study are essential as they reveal what factors impact the cooking time of an egg and help individuals boil their eggs to perfection.

## Methodology
The experiment involved three variables, two explanatory (independent variables) and one response (dependent variable). The explanatory variables were the salinity and the starting temperature of the water in which the egg was boiled. The response variable, measured, was the internal temperature of an egg in degrees Celsius after being boiled.

Forty large-sized eggs were randomly selected and boiled one at a time in a pot containing 750ml of water with four possible treatments. After 10 minutes had elapsed, the egg was removed from the pot and allowed to rest for thirty seconds at room temperature. The temperature was then measured using a digital instant read thermometer by inserting the probe approximately 11 millimetres into the bottom of the egg.

## Discussion and Results
Data was analyzed using two-way ANOVA on a model that tested the 'interaction effect' between water salinity and the water temperature. The hypotheses for the test were as follows:

1. Null Hypothesis: The interaction between water salinity and water temperature has no effect on the internal temperature of an egg
2. Alternative Hypothesis: The interaction between water salinity and the water temperature has an effect on the internal temperature of an egg

## Limitations
There were various limitations to the study, primarily stemming from equipment failure. The tool used to measure the internal temperature of the eggs, an instant read thermometer, failed with 8 trials to go and was replaced with another instant read thermometer of a different brand. This may have affected the accuracy of the measurements.

## Conclusion
The study suggests that both water temperature and water salinity had an impact on the cooking time of an egg. However, the validity of this experimental study may be compromised due to limitations introduced by equipment failure. Increased sample size and use of robust data analysis methods can improve the validity of the study in future investigations.
