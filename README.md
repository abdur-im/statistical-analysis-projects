## 1. Factors Influencing Egg Cooking Time

Completed in collaboration with a team from the University of Toronto for the course STA305H5 S, this study explored the influence of water temperature and salinity on the internal temperature of a boiled egg.
- **Report**: [EggCooking_SalinityTemp.pdf](https://github.com/abdur-im/statistical-analysis-projects/blob/main/EggCooking_SalinityTemp/EggCooking_SalinityTemp.pdf)
- **Key Findings**: Both water temperature and salinity play a role in determining the internal temperature of a boiled egg.
- **Limitations**: The validity of the study may be compromised due to equipment failure.

## 2. Smartphone Usage and Mental Health

In collaboration with a team from the University of Toronto for the course STA304H5 F, this project explored the impact of the 2020 global pandemic on the smartphone usage patterns and the mental well-being of students. 
- **Report**: [Smartphone_Usage_and_Mental_Health.pdf](https://github.com/abdur-im/statistical-analysis-projects/blob/main/Smartphone_Usage_and_Mental_Health/Smartphone_Usage_and_Mental_Health.pdf)
- **Key Findings**: Increased smartphone usage during the pandemic and a decline in mental well-being among students were observed.
- **Limitations**: The survey may lack reliability due to its low Cronbach‚Äôs alpha and participant selection bias.
